# CNN-optimization
Description:
This project is to optimize an existing CNN which can identify the image of cats within 3000 images. The goal is to speed up the process that it can identify 3000 cats per second. My final result is 3238 cats per seconds. I did this by different optimization techniques such as OpenMP parallelizing for, intel vectorization and SIMD.
